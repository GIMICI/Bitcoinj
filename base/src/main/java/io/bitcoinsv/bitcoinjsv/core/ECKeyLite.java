// TODO: Move this class to tracking compression state itself.
// The Bouncy Castle developers are deprecating their own tracking of the compression state.

/**
 * <p>Represents an elliptic curve public and (optionally) private key, usable for digital signatures but not encryption.
 * Creating a new ECKey with the empty constructor will generate a new random keypair. Other static methods can be used
 * when you already have the public or private parts. If you create a key with only the public part, you can check
 * signatures but not create them.</p>
 *
 * <p>ECKey also provides access to Bitcoin Core compatible text message signing, as accessible via the UI or JSON-RPC.
 * This is slightly different to signing raw bytes - if you want to sign your own data and it won't be exposed as
 * text to people, you don't want to use this. If in doubt, ask on the mailing list.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ECDSA algorithm supports <i>key recovery</i> in which a signature plus a couple of discriminator bits can
 * be reversed to find the public key used to calculate it. This can be convenient when you have a message and a
 * signature and want to find out who signed it, rather than requiring the user to provide the expected identity.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class supports a variety of serialization forms. The methods that accept/return byte arrays serialize
 * private keys as raw byte arrays and public keys using the SEC standard byte encoding for public keys. Signatures
 * are encoded using ASN.1/DER inside the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
 *
 * <p>A key can be <i>compressed</i> or <i>uncompressed</i>. This refers to whether the public key is represented
 * when encoded into bytes as an (x, y) coordinate on the elliptic curve, or whether it's represented as just an X
 * co-ordinate and an extra byte that carries a sign bit. With the latter form the Y coordinate can be calculated
 * dynamically, however, <b>because the binary serialization is different the address of a key changes if its
 * compression status is changed</b>. If you deviate from the defaults it's important to understand this: money sent
 * to a compressed version of the key will have a different address to the same key in uncompressed form. Whether
 * a public key is compressed or not is recorded in the SEC binary serialisation format, and preserved in a flag in
 * this class so round-tripping preserves state. Unless you're working with old software or doing unusual things, you
 * can usually ignore the compressed/uncompressed distinction.</p>
